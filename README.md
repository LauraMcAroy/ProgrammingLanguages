# ProgrammingLanguages

The final project for this course combined Python and C++ to create a project that gave the user options to view a complete list of all items purchased from a grocery store with the number of times each item was purchased, search for a specific item to view how many times it had been purchased, or view a histogram of all of the items that had been purchased. While it is functional, the code could be enhanced to create a more user friendly menu, alphabetize the results of the full item list, and align the search results and histogram. In line comments need to be added as well so that the code can be easily read by others. Effectively combining C++ and Python has been the most challenging obstacle I have faced in my degree program so far, even given the starter code. Setting up the IDE to allow both languages to communicate was only achieved through professional help, but several hours of struggling led me to a more comfortable knowledge of Visual Studio and gave me experience of what to look for when combining languages in the future.
Creating and calling functions in a program makes it more adaptable and maintainable then writing the entire code in main. The compartmentalization allows for new features to be added with minimal changes to main, and makes the code more readable.
